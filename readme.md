Users will be able to click on the 6 images provided, once clicked they’ll be able to see a small description. 

The users will be able to like the image as well, but it won’t save after the page refreshes. (I don’t want to mess the dbjson right now)

I’ll be using the website and the API that is provided to get my information: https://www.thecocktaildb.com/api.php
